This is a React.js user management app that connects to a Spring Boot backend using HTTP Basic Auth. Use Material-UI for all UI components. The app must have:
- Login form (username/password, stored in memory)
- User list (GET /api/users)
- Admin-only create, edit, delete user (POST/PUT/DELETE /api/users)
- Clean, modern UI using functional components and hooks
- All API calls must use HTTP Basic Auth with the credentials from the login form
